11/15/16 - Start
EnumWindows has access violations when trying to access (I'm guessing) 64-bit windows when compiled as 32-bit.
Should not be run as 32-bit on 64-bit Windows.

11/16/16 - tray app done. saving to registry. will need to try out several methods of identifying windows, since the title may change. going to try just using hWnd.

11/18/16 - Restore attempt. Windows went flying. GetWindowPos() is not enough. Need other state information. GetWindowPlacement/SetWindowPlacement, etc.

11/21/16 - Yay it works right. Storing data as REG_BINARY and using SetWindowPlacement was much easier.
Will have to check that monitors (screen size) supports restoring windows to their saved spots, otherwise skip.
Also will need some kind of whitelist, too many processes/funky fake windows...
